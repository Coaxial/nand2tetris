# nand2tetris
The goal of this project is to write a game of Tetris for a custom made computer.

In order to understand better how a computer works, I'll start by building logic gates using only NAND gates.

These primitive gates are then assembled into more complex chips to build an ALU, CPU, RAM etc all the way to writing a language for the newlly created computer, a compiler for it and, finally, the game of Tetris.

# Directories
`00`: Nothing special here, just a sample file written in HDL

`01`: Implement a set of logic gates from their truth tables using NAND gates (OR, AND, NOT, XOR, MUX, DMUX...)
